# Awesome Zero-Knowlege Proofs Starter Pack [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

*A curated collection of links for zero-knowledge proof cryptography used in blockchains. This is pretty much a repost of this [EthResearch post](https://ethresear.ch/t/zero-knowledge-proofs-starter-pack/4519).*

On my journey to join the [club of people](https://twitter.com/PaulRBerg/status/1044556551938363392) who possess a reasonable understanding of ZKP cryptography, I stumbled upon many invaluable resources that provided to be very helpful. The problem was that they were rather scattered. The [awesome ZKP repo](https://github.com/gluk64/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs) is indeed awesome but a bit verbose and lacks videos and podcasts.

The goal of this post is to serve as an entry point for anyone interested to make their baby steps towards understanding the core technical layers of zero-knowledge-whatever. It is important to note that this is definitely not an exhaustive list, but rather a set of supportive resources for ZKPs that have a connection to the blockchain ecosystem.

The list is periodically updated with new links. Click "Watch" in the right top corner to follow. Your contributions are welcomed. Add links [by yourself](contributing.md).
